Worst Case Run-time Complexities:

reverse(): O(n)
	reverse() will traverse through a List<T> performing two functions
	each iteration (2n) and will then traverse through a List<T> a
	second time to copy temp to *this (n). We are looking at a worst
	case of 3n (plus a few), which ultimately boils down to O(n).

remove_if(): O(n)
	remove_if() ultimately just traverses through a List<T> one time,
	with a few extra lower-order effects, giving it a worst case of 0(n).
